=  git-octopus, ease deployment and testing

include::banner.adoc[]

== Problem to solve

 * multiple branches
 * need to test them quickly
 * without deploying on multiple host
 * detect conflicts early

== Solution

 * flatten all branches to a temporary one
 * deploy the result to allow testing

== Tools

 * https://github.com/lesfurets/git-octopus[git-octopus] by LesFurets
 * Jenkins

== Process

 * Every developer work on his branches
 * Normalize naming relative to issues (`fix/XXX-123` or `feature/XXX-456`)
 * Manually trigger the octopus deploy (for the time being)

== Results

A meta branch containing everything flattened on top of your `master` branch.

== Tooling

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::../../main/jenkins/Jenkinsfile[tags=octopus]
----
<1> `git-octopus` has been installed with http://linuxbrew.sh[`linuxbrew`]
<2> We trigger the merge of a build parameter (`pass:[*/PR-*]` by default)

== Deploying

[source, groovy,indent=0]
----
include::../../main/jenkins/Jenkinsfile[tags=deploying]
----
<1> Building app job
<2> Parameter specifiying the branch to build
<3> The target machine as a parameter

== Conflicts ?

 * can they be resolved automatically ?
 * feature branch not merging cleanly with `master` branch ?
 * feature branches not merging cleanly with each other ?

== Automatic resolution

<1> Checkout the branch that does not merge cleanly with another
